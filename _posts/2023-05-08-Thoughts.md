How's it going, its May 2023. Here's a snapshot of some of the things in my head recently.


## AI zeitgeist is excruciating
Twitter has been pretty much AI hype and AI dread; and I think it's become a bit draining.

### AI Hype
Emergent abilities have been a big talking point. Suggested [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682.pdf), [announced on "60 Minutes"](https://virtualizationreview.com/articles/2023/04/21/llm-emergence.aspx) by Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and then refuted [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.15004). It's confusing times where research and PR are indistinguishable, especially to the general public.

The temptation to label things in such and such ways is understandable, as the current state-of-the-art has moved past so many barriers that were thought to be fundamental. It's a difficult topic to be level-headed about, especially as a company with its own marketing interests. I'm worried percieved exaggerations will do more harm than good for the field, many people are genuinely worried.

### AI Dread
I can't fault such cynicism with today's zeitgeist, where it seems a Kaczynskian anti-tech rhetoric has replaced optimism that technology can be developed solve humanity's problems. The naive optimism that technological progress will benefit humanity has faded away after decades of betrayal.

Yet it still stings that such inspiring breakthroughs have been met with such negativity.
After all, isn't it every scientist/engineer's aspirations to develop technology to progress humanity? To see it become something so feared and dreaded, hurts.


## Deleted my model
I accidentally deleted my experiments folder last week, losing my model and other data. Turns out the automatic command sent by VSCode ("conda activate ###h" + enter) can delete your entire folder if you were in NCDU (d triggers deletion, h moves cursor from "no" to "yes", and enter lets it rip). For reproducibility's sake I'll need to redo the experiments with the new one. That'll be something to explain to reviewers...

## Going to ACL2023
As announced [here](/2023/05/08/Going-To-ACL.html), I'm going to ACL2023! Check the post for a very cool drawing.
This will be my second ACL conference I attend, so I'll try to be less shy this time.
