## TL;DR
Cyber-capabilities are a concern for LLMs for good reason. Most current benchmarks are simplifications of real world scenarios. So currently there is still some confusion on how we can view and discuss current capabilities of LLMs when it comes to cyberattack/security.

## Introduction
Cyber-capability of LLMs is dual-use as it benefits both attackers and defenders. Many are concerned that proliferation of cybersecurity/hacking expertise being much more accessible via LLMs, that barriers of entry for crime will be much easier. Such concerns are quite reasonable as underground forums have precedents of service models that do this, such as Exploit-as-a-service or Ransomware-as-a-service. As someone who has had my own [work](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.415/) become apparent inspiration to some [cybercrime enabling AI services](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/gpt-based-malware-trains-dark-web), I know there will be markets, demands, and sellers that try to do this.

While I'm quite sure that the service in the previous link is a scam, it should demonstrate that when powerful models capable of highly technical cybercrime *do* become available, there will be a demand to abuse it. Therefore, it is of great importance that current and future generations of models to be evaluated in their capability to perform cybersecurity/cyberoffensive analysis.

Some of my personal takes on this problem.

1. Previously, cybersecurity domain knowledge was often considered a huge bottleneck for previous generations of models ([I even worked on addressing this!](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-naacl.3/)). However, current LLMs are generally quite knowledgeable even in the cybersecurity domain. I no longer believe evaluating for domain knowledge is an important measure to understanding the capabilities and potential threats regarding LLMs. The focus should shift on what tasks and problems they are able to solve.

2. Cybersecurity workflow is very complex. It can involve anything between analyzing code, network behavior, logs, threat group activity, etc. Many works tend to simplify the whole workflow when defining a single scope of "cybersecurity expertise". It would be helpful to identify a specific task or behavior to be analyzed (with high utility), in order to evaluate them properly.


Below are some papers I think are quite important.

### WMDP 
The [WMDP Dataset by Li et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03218) is a carefully crafted multi-choice question benchmark intended to assess knowledge connected to harmful capabilities of LLMs. The intention is to use expert-level knowledge as a *proxy* for harmful capabilities that can arise in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security.

I think that for cybersecurity, it's difficult to construct MC questions that can reflect abilities we care/worry about like execution of exploits. To quote, "To measure a modelâ€™s exploitation abilities, we sourced questions involving common exploitation frameworks such as Metasploit." But whether familiarity of frameworks to answer questions like "What is the default beacon time for the Dropbox agent in Empire?" can lead to successful exploitation is unclear.

### CONSIDERATIONS FOR EVALUATING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CYBERSECURITY TASKS
This [white paper by Gennari et al.](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/documents/5848/Considerations_for_Evaluating_Large_Language_Models_for_Cybersecurity_Tasks.pdf) includes a great description of the complexity of cybersecurity expertise, and argues how many evaluations limited to knowledge probing can miss other considerations. Three levels of evaluations are proposed 1) Throetical Knowledge Evaluation (Domain Knowledge assessments), 2) Practical Knowledge Evaluation (Ability to provide solutions to self-contained scenarios), and 3) Applied Knowledge Evaluation (the complex work of achieving higher level objectives in open-ended situations). The distinction between 2 and 3 is important, and will indicate whether an LLM's problem-solving abilities extends beyond artificial textbook scenarios.


### LLMs/Agents can hack/exploit...
This series of papers on using LLMs for [website hacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06664), [exploiting one-day vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08144), and [exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01637) are great prototypes for LLMs being successfully used in attack scenarios. The described scenarios are compelling, and show success in small datasets. However, there might be some disagreements on how to interpret the results. There's some blog posts from a cybersecurity perspective on the [first](https://struct.github.io/llm_auto_hax.html) and [second](http://struct.github.io/auto_agents_1_day.html) papers that strongly disagree with the main conclusions. These posts show how there is a clear gap between perspectives on how exploit capability should be measured.

The author of the paper below tries to explain this perspective gap [here](https://tchauvin.com/cybersecurity-and-ai-safety).

### Eyeballvul

The [eyevallvul by Timothee Chauvin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08708) is a benchmark I am very excited about. It is a pipeline to convert entries in the [OSV project](https://osv.dev/) database into a benchmark of (real-world) codebases and known vulnerabilities. What OSV does is use vulnerability disclosures to find affected versions of software. Putting them together, we can get vulnerable codebases along with labels of what was vulnerable about them. This problem setting is very compelling because it most accurately reflects the desired application scenario of LLMs being used to diagnose for vulnerabilities at the codebase level. There's a lot of things to try out with this benchmark. So far, the paper works with a basic prompt, instructing the LLM to find vulnerabilities, and filling up the context window with code. In this raw setting, LLMs do not perform very well.


### LLM-Assisted Static Analysis for Detecting Security Vulnerabilities

A more reasonable way to utilize LLMs for vulnerability detection is to give them the tools a human expert would utilize in doing the task. This [paper by Li et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17238) does exactly this, getting LLMs to make better usage of the SAST tool CodeQL. The proposed framework uses LLMs to do two things 1) select inputs (specifications) for CodeQL and 2) reviews results for false positives. Both are beneficial for analysis. The paper also presents a curated dataset. The high-performing models manage to find around half the vulnerabilities in the dataset, which is much better than a raw analysis scenario as above as well as the CodeQL preset specifications.
