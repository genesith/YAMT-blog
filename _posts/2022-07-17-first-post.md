Finally got around setting this thing up. It feels a bit counterintuitive how I've avoided giving out any personal information online all this time just to end up compiling all of my social media here.

What I want to use this for is also currently undecided. Sure I have a million thoughts I can write about, but whether I should write them in such a public manner is questionable. I'll have to figure it all out, and probably make more pages along the way. We'll see how it goes.
